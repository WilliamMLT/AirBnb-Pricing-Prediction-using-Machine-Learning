# Machine-Learning-to-Analyze-Airbnb-Data
This project is about conducting machine learning to analyze Airbnb data, to find out how hosts on Airbnb should price their listings that would lead to higher profits for them in the long run in one of the most popular destinations worldwide - New York.

In particular, the following three questions will be answered:
 - How do rental properties vary across the neighborhoods in New York
 - How do prices vary with neighborhoods, rental property types, and rental amenities
 - How to predict Airbnb rental prices using features such as property type, number of beds, past reviews, etc

Lasso Regression was used as the final model to predict the listing prices of any property in NY City with a variation of $43. 

The outcome of this project provided recommended prices of their properties to hosts along with other recommendations. Hosts can use the findings to enhance the attractiveness of their listings.

### Note:
There is an additional dataset that cannot be uploaded due to size restrictions, it is called the 'listings.csv', which can be obtained from Inside Airbnb, New York City
